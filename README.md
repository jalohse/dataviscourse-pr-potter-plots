# dataviscourse-pr-potter-plots

Our project looks at various different pieces of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and visualizes them. We specifically look at the word count of each book/chapter, the number of deaths throughout the series and in particular books, spells mentioned, locations the story takes place in, and the interactions between characters in each book.
