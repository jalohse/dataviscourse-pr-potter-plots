# dataviscourse-pr-potter-plots

Our project looks at various different pieces of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and visualizes them. We specifically look at the word count of each book/chapter, the number of deaths throughout the series and in particular books, spells mentioned, locations the story takes place in, and the interactions between characters in each book.

These visualizations were created through the library <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js<a>.

The finished product can be found <a href="http://jessicaalohse.com/dataviscourse-pr-potter-plots/">here</a>.
